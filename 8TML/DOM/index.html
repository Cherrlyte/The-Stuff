<body>
  Random Text without any specific tags.
  <h1>Random Text with H1 tag.</h1>
  <h2>Now over to H2.</h2>
  <h3>And now over to... IS THIS COMIC SANS?</h3>

  <div id="yapping" style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
    In theory, all non-H3 tags (AKA Children of Body) wield the "Verdana" font, while h3 wields "Comic Sans". <br>
    In practice, it works, and i hate it. <br> <br>
    How it works: <br>
    CSS Styling follows a DOM tree, as in, Document Object Model. The name doesn't matter though, what matters is what
    it does. <br>
    DOM makes it so styling is applied by object, which by default makes it so that <i>EVERY object with specific styling WILL receive such styling.</i> <br>
    EXAMPLE: If i have a completely populated body element with multiple other elements (h1, h3, div, i, whatever), ALL
    elements with their styling defined WILL be styled accordingly. Those who don't have defined styling will, by
    default, inherit the styling from their parent element .
    <br> <br>
    Think of it like this: The element div doesn't have styling, but the parent element (header) does, which means: <br>
    Header ===> Div <br>
    But the h3 element inside div does have its own styling, so it does a: <br>
    Header ===> Div =X=> H3 <i style="color: gray; font-size: .45em;">(( =X=> as in H3 does not inherit styling, rather uses its own. ))</i> <br>
    However, if we give the div elements its own style AND remove h3's... <br>
    Header =X=> Div ===> H3 <i style="color: gray; font-size: .45em;">(( =X=> as in Div doesn't inherit styling, rather uses its own. ))</i> <br>
    Div doesn't inherit styling, and H3 inherits Div's. <br> <br>
    Also, funny thing, it doesn't matter how low in the hierarchy it is, if it's defined, it WILL use styling. <br>
    Header ===> Div ===> Div =X=> Article ===> Div ===> Div =X=> Article ===> Div ===> P =X=> Em <i style="color: gray; font-size: .45em;">(( =X=> as in element doesn't inherit styling, since it has its own. ))</i> <br> <br>
    Also, notice how EVERY element gets their styling inherited (except for Em, of course). That means you can style one element and ALL ITS CHILDREN WILL BE STYLED LIKE IT.
    An example is a div with fifteen thousand p elements as children will naturally style all those fifteen thousand elements the same as it is styled.
